# Let’s Go Splunking!


## *Step 1: The Need for Speed*

### **1.Based on the report you created, what is the approximate date and time of the attack?**
 
     2020-02-23 @ 14:30:00


### **2.How long did it take your systems to recover?**

## *Step 2: Are We Vulnerable?*

### **4.Provide a screenshot of your report:**

![]()


### **5.Provide a screenshot showing that the alert has been created:**

## *Step 3: Drawing the (Base)line*

### **6.When did the brute force attack occur?**

     Looking at the previous morning it actually appears that the attempts might have actually started at 4:00am on 2/21/2020, it appears to be irregular for as many people “failed” prior to 8 as they did, but really started to ramp up the attempts, during business hours, from 8:00am on the same day and continued until 2pm.


### **7.Determine a baseline of normal activity and a threshold that would alert if a brute force attack is occurring:**

     A normal baseline seems  to be under 20 attempts and a good threshold for an alert for bruteforce attempts would be 30.


### **8.Provide a screenshot showing that the alert has been created:**

![]()
